pyjcdht
=======

Bittorrent DHT module for python, using the nice C implementation written by Juliusz Chroboczek (http://www.pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~jch/software/bittorrent/), which is also used in the transmission torrent client.

- Requires only (on Debian): python-dev build-essential (recommended: libssl-dev)
- Not tested much
- Should work with Python 3 too
